# Sprint Ceremonies

## Daily Standup

Purpose: quick check-in on Sprint/Iteration progress
Attendees: internal team
Duration: 15 minutes
Time of day: to be determined by the team
Inputs: from each team member - What did you do yesterday?  What are you doing today? Do you have any blockers?
Method: walk through scrum board (either formally or as a mnemonic, per team or individual preference)
Output: Blockers and problems to be solved through collaboration are placed in a ‘parking lot’ to be addressed after Standup.  (No problem solving during Standup).


## Planning

Purpose: review items for next Sprint
Attendees: internal team
Duration: 2 hours at the beginning of the first day of the Sprint
Inputs: groomed and prioritized backlog for the Sprint
Method: review stories in order, address any questions or requirements that need further clarification
Output: finalized backlog for the Sprint, updates/clarifications added to user stories, general notions of who will take what, where the challenges will come from, new risks identified/known risks to be mitigated by the expected output


## Demo

Inputs: Work that passed all tests and successfully merged in time for the demo
Method: Demo new functionality added to the system
Output: Client acceptance of completed work, feedback on project direction/priorities, working solution in staging environment for further client review (this could be happening throughout the Sprint as items pass QA, merge, and deploy.
